This is 'dubdub'

I'm not sure what 'dubdub' is yet.  Best guess is some database-ish thing.
Document-oriented, key/value store, map/reduce to query, parallel, distributed,
and fault tolerant, with an analytics bent.  You know, the usuals.

see https://github.com/boorad/dubdub/wikis for our latest docs.
