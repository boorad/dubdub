This directory is for generating and loading test data.

Data is pulled from a rdbms and .dat files are constructed with the
testdata:gen/0 function.

.dat files are Erlang structures, different ones depending on the constants set
in testdata.erl.  We will have many different types, including json, tuple,
dict, gb_trees, etc. and try to zero in on the most performant data structure
for our needs.

The data originates from a PostgreSQL database on boorad's local laptop.
However, the data isn't scrambled / randomized enough to give it out yet.  I
hope to add a bit more scrambling so I can post the dat files to github.

Then we can have base .dat files and duplicate the data over and over, for
different stores and years to create a truly large dataset for even more
integration testing.
